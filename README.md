# tmp_octavebands

## Octave band generator, using C++ template metaprogramming.

### Why?

I am using it to gain a better understanding of C++ in general, experiment with TMP, ~~demonstrate my level of insanity,~~ and planning on using it in an app I'm currently working on.

### Headers and Classes

Ignore the tmp_octavebands.cpp and .h for now. They were generated by VS and I have not had a chance to add the proper exports yet.

* Calculations.hpp: Should contain all the calculations I'm using, but some ended up in DoubleMath.hpp during a late night code binge.
* CenterFrequencies.hpp: __CenterFrequencies__ structure containing a __std::tuple__ of __TMP_Fraction__ objects and an unfinished center frequency generation factory.
* Enums.hpp: Pretty self explanatory...
* Fraction.hpp: The __Fraction__ object and it's templated wrapper: __TMP_Fraction__.
* OctaveBand.hpp: The __OctaveBand__ object and it's templated wrapper: __OctaveBandCreator__. (Yes, I will be revisiting the naming conventions)
* OctaveBandFactory.hpp: Contains all the metafunctions required to generate the octave bands.
* OctaveUtil.hpp: Utilities utilized by the factory metafunctions.
* TMP_Utils.hpp: Most of my generic metafunctions, collections, etc.
* ParamPack.hpp: Parameter pack typelist utilized for internal type storage.
